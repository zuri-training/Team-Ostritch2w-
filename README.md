## Project Scope

This project involves the creation of a simple QR generator. Users
will be able to see some basic information but not allowed to use the
QR generator unless they are registered. This is to limit the number
of users who might use the QR 'for the fun of it' (AWS bills are no joke!) and allow for some
level of privacy.

## Problem Statement

QR codes are fast becoming popular these days. Most people are
drifting away from the traditional mode of advertising/marketing and
just storing their digital information online in QR codes. QR codes
are almost everywhere; banks, hospitals, hotels, restaurants etc. But the question on everyone’s lips is how do they come about these codes?

These codes are generated online by an online software called QR code
generator. From secondary research, a lot of these platforms are not
simplified enough for beginners to use. And to tackle that problem, we
will be following the popular saying: “Less is more". A platform will
be designed and built in a way that allows users to generate QR codes
with less hassle. The QR code(s) generated can be downloaded and
shared on whichever social media platform one is on, amongst many
other features and when scanned, will lead to a user's portfolio
website/catalogue, personal bio-data... the possibilities are endless
but for this project, the team will keep things simple.

## Modalities

<a id="unauthorized"></a>

### User: Unauthenticated

- 1st and 2nd features.

The first requirement is that users should visit the platform and get to see information about the platform. Hence, a landing page for the project. The second feature entails a view demo button.

- 3rd and 4th features.

The 3rd feature includes a sign up page /login page and 4th feature suggests (as required) a functionality to the sign up fields (which means that anyone that visits the site will be required to login first, before getting to see all other features/functionalities of the site).

### User: Authenticated

- Once the users login, they get full access to the platform.

- Generated QR codes can be downloaded, shared online amongst many other features and when scanned will lead to the users' portfolio websites or catalogues.

- User Dashboard Section Design - A personal space for the user to save and manage (manipulate) their respective QR codes.

- Allow user save data and come back to it, like they never left

## User Case Scenario

> “I am a developer, I set up a profile on the proposed application with
>my portfolio links, after which a QR code is generated for me. I
>havean option of sharing the QR code to social media or download it
>on my phone."

> "I wish there was a way to pay for my groceries without fishing
> about for my credit card. My banking app has the QR feature but no
> one is using it. Oh look,this store supports QR, life just got
